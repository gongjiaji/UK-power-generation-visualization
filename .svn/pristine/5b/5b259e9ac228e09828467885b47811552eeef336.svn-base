13/12/2017 (Hamza Butt)

  Added a basic GUI, currently has 3 screens.
  All files are commented and explanations have been given.

  * Uses a CardPanel layout; series of JPanels
  * Allows easy further implementation of panels.
  * Created a basic menu; a hub where the user can select where they wish to go.

  19/01/2018 (Gong Jiaji, CSV Parser )

  * Csv parser requires external library ( JavaCSV ), download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/javacsv/
  * API DOC : http://javacsv.sourceforge.net/
  * added file: gridwatch.csv for testing
  * added function csv parser under ButtonHandler (action 3)
    you have 2 ways to select data:
      1. use csv reader object and apply methods in the library
      2. copy all contents to array list and apply methods in STL
    Both are useful in certain circumstance, I left 2 examples for your reference. Please see comments for details


  25/01/2018 (Gong Jiaji, File Chooser )

  * File Chooser implemented. Now user could press "select file" button to browse then select file. Press "Read file" to
  process the file. (ButtonHandler -- action 4)
  * a filter to reject non csv / excel files
  * by far the program working well on my machine
  * I didn't change the previous design on file selection frame, so please amend the GUI


  01/02/2018 (Gong Jiaji, File selection refine)
  * refined file selection frame, removed TextFiled, replaced it with a JLabel which indicating file path that user selected.
  * a clear button added, user could clear selection in case of mis-clicking.


  10/02/2018 (Gong Jiaji, File selection refine)
  * Now user can't enter main frame if file name is empty.
  * integrate Csv parser in class, you can now create methods in <Csv.class> and apply methods under <ButtonHandler.class> to get data.
    e.g. csv.getRows(10) to get first 10 rows.
  * PLEASE NOTE, i'v deactivated the code at line 859 in SearchForData.class for testing purpose.

  11/02/2018 (Matei Rusu, searchForData)
  *all the fields for search are done
  *the user can't input a value for search that is incorrect

  13/02/2018 (Hamza Butt; DataSnippet, DateFormmater)

  * Date selection interface requires external libraries - jdatepicker-1.3.2
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/jdatepicker/files/Releases/1.3.x/
  * Created a custom date formatter (DateFormatter) can be applied in combination with
    a standard UtilDateModel object to produce the desired result (see module/GUI output for details).
  * Custom abstract formatter can be reused and applied elsewhere in the program too.

  13/02/2018 (Matei Rusu, searchForData)
  *searching after timestamp,id,demand and frequency
  *no visual output
  *all the records that meet the criteria for those fields are saved in an 2D array
  *the print of the array if fo test purposes feel free comment that

  15/02/2018 (Hamza Butt; DataSnippet, PostDataSnippet)

  * Data snippet function fully implemented; only minor validation (mostly validated) remaining.
  * Data is all extracted from CSV and stored in an arraylist; processed and the final result is a new ArrayList containing
    the snippet
  * User inputs a date selection, on button click and JTable is generated dynamically in a dialogue; user can then proceed
    by button click and this implicitly closes the dialogue.
  * All data is still stored and can be accesssed statically through the reference -> PostDataSnippet.snippedData

  15/02/2018 (Matei Rusu, searchForData)
  *search function is ready
  *I need to change the data structure from an 2D array to an array list


  15/02/2018 (Hamza Butt, DataSnippet)

  * Removed hanging commas from JTable display.
  * Restricted max snippet length to 7 days
  * Restricted snippet ranges to those only available in file (limited by earliest/latest date in csv file).
  * Removed unnecessary import statements.

  15/02/2018 (Kai Roper-Blackman, LineChart)
  *JFreeChart download link https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/1.%20JFreeChart/1.0.1/jfreechart-1.0.1.zip/download?use_mirror=kent&download=

  *Need to change data input type
  *Need to change from jpeg generator to AWT window or allow program to display jpeg after generation

  22/02/2018 (Hamza Butt, Minor changes)

  * Fixed issue with Java heap space - user clicking back and forth results in an out of memory exception
  * Changed structure so heap space is cleared at the relavant times.
  * Added new action in button handler (5) to fix/simplify this.


  21/02/2018 (Kai Roper-Blackman, LineChart, scatterGraph)
  *data input type changed
